### SysConfig Notice

All examples will soon be supported by SysConfig, a tool that will help you 
graphically configure your software components. A preview is available today in 
the examples/syscfg_preview directory. Starting in 3Q 2019, with SDK version 
3.30, only SysConfig-enabled versions of examples will be provided. For more 
information, click [here](http://www.ti.com/sysconfignotice).

-------------------------

Project Setup using the System Configuration Tool (SysConfig)
-------------------------
The purpose of SysConfig is to provide an easy to use interface for configuring 
drivers, RF stacks, and more. The .syscfg file provided with each example 
project has been configured and tested for that project. Changes to the .syscfg 
file may alter the behavior of the example away from default. Some parameters 
configured in SysConfig may require the use of specific APIs or additional 
modifications in the application source code. More information can be found in 
SysConfig by hovering over a configurable and clicking the question mark (?) 
next to it's name.

### EasyLink Stack Configuration
Many parameters of the EasyLink stack can be configured using SysConfig 
including RX, TX, Radio, and Advanced settings. More information can be found in 
SysConfig by hovering over a configurable and clicking the question mark (?) 
next to it's name. Alternatively, refer to the System Configuration Tool 
(SysConfig) section of the Proprietary RF User's guide found in 
&lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/docs/proprietary-rf/proprietary-rf-users-guide.html. 

Example Summary
---------------
The WSN Concentrator example illustrates how to create a simple Wireless Sensor
Network Concentrator device which listens for packets from other nodes. This
example is meant to be used together with the WSN Node example to form a one-
to-many network where the nodes send messages to the concentrator.

This examples showcases the use of several Tasks, Semaphores and Events to
receive packets, send acknowledgments and display the received data on the
LCD. For the radio layer, this example uses the EasyLink API which provides
an easy-to-use API for the most frequently used radio operations.

For more information on the EasyLink API and usage refer to the [Proprietary RF User's guide](http://dev.ti.com/tirex/#/?link=Software%2FSimpleLink%20CC13x2%2026x2%20SDK%2FDocuments%2FProprietary%20RF%2FProprietary%20RF%20User's%20Guide)


Peripherals Exercised
---------------
* `Board_PIN_LED0` - Toggled when data is received over the RF interface

Resources & Jumper Settings
---------------

> If you're using an IDE (such as CCS or IAR), please refer to Board.html in your project
directory for resources used and board-specific jumper settings. Otherwise, you can find
Board.html in the directory &lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/source/ti/boards/&lt;BOARD&gt;.

## Board Specific Settings
1. The WSN examples use the custom physical mode by default, which sets
the center frequency to:
    - 433.92 MHz for the CC1350-LAUNCHXL-433
    - 433.92/490 MHz for the CC1352P-4-LAUNCHXL
    - 2440 MHz on the CC2640R2-LAUNCHXL
    - 868.0 MHz for other launchpads
In order to change frequency, modify the smartrf_settings.c file. This can be
done using the code export feature in Smart RF Studio, or directly in the file
2. On the CC1352P1 the high PA is enabled (high output power) for all
Sub-1 GHz modes by default.
3. On the CC1352P-2 the high PA operation for Sub-1 GHz modes is not supported
4. On the CC1352P-4 the high PA is enabled (high output power) for all
Sub-1 GHz modes by default.
    - The center frequency for 2-GFSK is set to 490 MHz
    - **CAUTION:** The center frequency for SimpleLink long range (SLR) is set to 433.92 MHz,
    but the high output power violates the maximum power output requirement
    for this band
5. The CC2640R2 is setup to run all proprietary physical modes at a center
frequency of 2440 MHz, at a data rate of 250 Kbps

Example Usage
---------------
Run the example. On another board (or several boards) run the WSN Node example.
The LCD will show the discovered node(s). When the collector receives data from
a new node, it is given a new row on the display and the received value is shown.
If more than 7 nodes are detected, the device list rolls over, overriding
the first. Whenever an updated value is received from a node, it is updated on
the LCD display.

Application Design Details
---------------
This examples consists of two tasks, one application task and one radio
protocol task.

The ConcentratorRadioTask handles the radio protocol. This sets up the EasyLink
API and uses it to always wait for packets on a set frequency. When it receives
a valid packet, it sends an ACK and then forwards it to the ConcentratorTask.

The ConentratorTask receives packets from the ConcentratorRadioTask, displays
the data on the LCD and toggles Board_PIN_LED0.

*RadioProtocol.h* can also be used to change the
PHY settings to be either the default IEEE 802.15.4g 50kbit,
Long Range Mode or custom settings. In the case of custom settings,
the *smartrf_settings.c* file is used. This can be changed either
by exporting from Smart RF Studio or directly in the file.

Note for IAR users: When using the CC1310DK, the TI XDS110v3 USB Emulator must
be selected. For the CC1310_LAUNCHXL, select TI XDS110 Emulator. In both cases,
select the cJTAG interface.
